<p id="text1" class="text"> In a nutshell, semi-private training is a personal training program designed specifically for you accounting for: your individual history, physical needs, current abilities, short-term and long-term goals, your schedule. Your program and sessions are then coached by a personal trainer.</p>

<p class="headings" id="partner"> Partner Training</p>
<p id="text2" class="text"> Partner training is filled with constantly varied exercises programmed by a certified personal trainer. Your trainer will develop workouts and options that are appropriate for everyone in the group. Working out with a partner can make you push harder, do more than you would if you were working out on your own. It’s a great way to expect – and get – more from yourself during your time in the gym. </p>
